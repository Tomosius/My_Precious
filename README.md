## User Experience and Design

### Strategy

**Site Aims**: "My Precious" caters to anyone who has lost or found an item, emphasizing the power of community assistance. It's about transforming despair into joy, one post at a time. By fostering connections, we not only return lost items but also have the potential to forge lasting friendships.

### Execution

**Project Milestones**:

1. **Project Setup**: Establish the foundational structure, including initial app creation, database setup, GitHub repository, and Heroku deployment.
2. **User Authentication**: Implement secure login mechanisms and personal profile management.
3. **CRUD for Posts**: Enable users to create, read, update, and delete posts about lost and found items.
4. **Messaging System**: Facilitate user communication through direct messages.
5. **User-Friendly Design**: Prioritize intuitive navigation and layout design for an optimal user experience.
6. **Final Deployment**: Ensure a bug-free launch with full access to all project features.

### User Stories

- Authentication: Users can log in, authenticate, and log out.
- Profile Management: Users can update their profiles and add personal images.
- Post Interaction: Users have full control over creating and managing their posts, including adding photos and locations.
- Community Engagement: Authenticated users can view, search, and interact with posts and profiles of other users.
- Direct Messaging: Users can communicate privately through the built-in messaging system.

## App Structure

"My Precious" is built around three core applications:

1. **Users**: Manages user authentication and profiles.

### Users:
1. Users App is made of 2 tables:
   * Auth User - This is Default Django model, I could, but I did not want to implement more fields to model, I left it as it is, simple and reliable Django built in Model for Authentication
   * Profile - This table is linked to Auth-User as 1-to-1 relationship:
     * This allows me to add as many fields as I want to user Profile
     * Do not have to touch Django build in User model for Authentication
     * If needed (for this project I did not see need), one user can have multiple Profiles. Just change relationship as 1-to-many
     * And most important 0- scalability. In such existing structure, App can be very fast, easy to create as many fields in profile, and light on database
   â€¢ Photo - Profile picture, linked to Profile with 1-to-1 relationship
2. Posts App consists of several tables:
   * Posts - This is Polymorphic Model. Yes, I had to use it, as initially (start of project) I wanted to implement DRY coding and used standard model Post as abstract, and then create 2 models based on it:
     * Lost Post
     * Found Post
     * Photos - Lost and Found posts have sub tables of Photos 
     
Smart Explanation why I had to switch from Abstract model to Polymorphic:

    All is because of search Field and Pagination. Search in 2 tables and paginate is a nightmare...
In standard model I can search Lost Posts, I can search Found posts, I can search both. But if I search 2 tables, and then I want to paginate it - it becomes complicated, this is where polymorphic model comes in.

3. Conversations consists of 2 tables:
    * Conversations - This is where one conversation can have as many participants as it is needed
    * Messages - this is just simple message linked to conversation and sender


Each app was built with intention of future re-usability, so they are pretty much independent:
* They have their own templates in app/templates folder 
* They have their own urls in app/urls.py, these urls are imported to project urls.

## Tools and Technologies:
###Tools:

###Languages:
* HTML - Used for static HTML files and templates
* Bootstrap5 and custom styles.css - layouts styling
* Javascript - page interactivity and dynamic content management
* Python - main language of project
* Django - Python framework
* Some Jquery/Ajax - some pages required some background interactions to database, so I adapted code snippets from internet for my project
* SQL - database queries

## Testing
### Responsiveness
Website was checked for responsiveness all time during development, checking layouts for different types and sizes of screens and devices.

### Validation
#### HTML
Website was inspected through [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org).
Every page has gone through procedures:
1. Open page on running Django project
2. Right click on page to inspect code
3. Copy all HTML code
4. Paste to Validator as 'direct input'
#### CSS
To validate Css I have used [W3C CSS Jigsaw Validator]
Custom styles.css file was uploaded and validated
(https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

### Preparing the Environment and `settings.py` File

Before running the application, ensure that your environment and Django settings are correctly configured:

#### Configuration Guide

1. `DATABASE_URL` (Recommended: PostgreSQL)
   - **Heroku Configuration:**
     - In the Settings tab of your Heroku dashboard, click on 'Reveal Config Vars'.
     - Copy the URL next to `DATABASE_URL`.
   - **Local Setup:**
     - In your workspace, create an `env.py` file in the main directory.
     - Add the `DATABASE_URL` value to this file.

2. `SECRET_KEY`
   - Add the `SECRET_KEY` value to the Config Vars in Heroku.
   - Ensure this key is also stored securely in your `env.py` file for local development.

3. `CLOUDINARY` for Image Storage
   - **Configuration Variables:**
     - `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`
     - `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`
     - `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET`
   - **Updating Config Vars:**
     - Update the Config Vars on Heroku with the Cloudinary variables.
     - Ensure these are also correctly referenced in your `env.py`.

4. `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`
   - Store and reference your Google Maps API key as needed for location-based features in both Heroku and your `env.py`.

### Deploying on Heroku

1. Create the Heroku App:
   - Select "Create new app" in Heroku.
   - Choose a name for your app and select the location.

2. Store Static and Media files in Cloudinary and Deploy to Heroku:
   - Create three directories in the main directory; media, storage, and templates.
   - Create a file named "Procfile" in the main directory and add the following:
     ```
     web: gunicorn project-name.wsgi
     ```
   - Go to the Deploy tab on Heroku, connect to the GitHub, then to the required repository.
   - Click on "Deploy Branch" and wait for the build to load. When the build is complete, the app can be opened through Heroku.

### Forking the Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps:

1. Log into [GitHub](https://github.com/login) or [create an account](https://github.com/join).
2. Locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Tomosius/My_Precious).
3. At the top of the repository, on the right side of the page, select "Fork".
4. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

## Mistakes and Bugs
![w3c_mistake_1.png](staticfiles%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Fw3c_mistake_1.png)
![w3c_mistake_2.png](staticfiles%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Fw3c_mistake_2.png)
There is following mistakes in project, but they are needed, as Profile Page is needing Buttons with href, as it is dynamic page.
On big screen it is 2 separate columns:
1. Left side - User Profile
2. User Posts - if sending message, content will be replaced to messages and afterward posts will be displayed again


On smaller screens User is given 2 tabs:
1. User Profile
2. Posts

Buttons are needed with href, as if visiting another user profile, current (authorised) user can send a message, which will be added to existing conversation, if such does not exist, new one will be created.
When clicking on message button, Javascript will replace Posts in html with messages from conversation. when it is closed, all messages will be hidden and post will be displayed.
At the same time, there is second javascript, that copies HTML code from one part to another, so there is no need to create page 2 times (write code 2 times. DRY)

## Future Implementations
1. Get decent hosting service for project, database and images hosting - increase app speed
2. PostgresSQL - install PostGIS, Django - GeoDjango API. this would enable search by location and better UX
3. Improve Site Layout (Sorry but my creativity with layouts is minimal... I am more maths and physics person)
4. Add Password recovery. Even I created gmail specifically for project, somehow google is not very keen to allow such easy access for project to emails...
